        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p> i am a recent MSc graduate, where i studied an emerging field of data science (metabolomics) </p>
        <p> in the course of my studies, I found a passion for creating things with programming  </p>

            <img class="skill-image-left" src="images/python.png" alt="python">
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p align="right"> I initially learned python to make use of pandas, numpy and matplotlib to generate and harness machine learning models,
            process, clean, and visualize my metabolomics dataset. Along the way, I decided to devote at least an hour a day to engineering a project, for 100 days straight.
                As a result, I am extremely comfortable with python and object-oriented programming. </p>

            <img class="skill-image-right" src="images/R_logo.png" alt="">
            <h3> R </h3>
            <p align="left"> R is the gold-standard programming language for academia. As such, I have been an avid user of R for 4+ years.
                My interest in R for statistical analyses, machine learning and data visualization began whilst I was conducting my honours research thesis.
            During the course of my MSc, I have trained and utilized machine learning models varying in complexity (from linear regression, all the way to neural networks) using datasets from Kaggle, ISLR and the UCI ML Repository. </p>

        <div class="skill-row">
            <img class="skill-image-left" src="images/SQL_logo.png" alt="">
            <h3> SQL </h3>
            <p align="right">I enjoy using all kinds of SQL, though postgreSQL is my favourite.
                I have been using it for 2 years, completely out of interest in it and a yearning to be able to control/utilize relational database systems which sometimes contain millions of rows.
                The server for my main website is completely made in python, allowing for data exploration/manipulation to be preformed with Psycopg2 (PostgreSQL module). </p>

            <h3> HTML5 </h3>
            <p align="left"> I have worked with HTML5 for 1 year and I utilized HTML5 to form the foundation of this and my main website.</p>

            <h3> Java </h3>
            <p align="left">I have been working with java for 2 years, so as to execute scripts to apply machine learning models to my
            raw spectral dataset in MZMine, through a unix Biocluster. Additionally, I have utilized it to provide all fo the functionality of my main website. </p>
