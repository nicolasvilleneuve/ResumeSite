## ResumeSite
This website is my resume, graphically represented through hosting with github pages. As it is hosted with github pages, the server.py file serves no purpose. Within the coming week(s), I will be converting the back-end to Django and hosting with Heroku. The link will be updated when this change is made.

## Description
This website is meant to be living proof to instatntiate the claims of my resume, displaying that I know how toi create original designs using HTML5/CSS3/JS and Bootstrap5.
